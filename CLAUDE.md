# MagickUtils

Utility tool for MagickVoice customers to **download, merge, and analyze** their voice-call and
messaging campaign data. See `PROPOSAL.md` for the full architecture and rationale.

## Stack
- **Next.js 16** (App Router, Turbopack) · **React 19** · **TypeScript** · **Tailwind v4**
- **Recharts** (charts), **lucide-react** (icons, via the `Icon` wrapper), fonts via `next/font`
  (Plus Jakarta Sans + JetBrains Mono).
- Target deploy: a **single long-running Node host** (Render/Railway/Fly) — NOT Vercel serverless —
  so long-running jobs (ingestion, CSV merge, AI analysis) can run in-process. State in **MongoDB
  Atlas**. LLM is **provider-agnostic** (OpenAI-compatible: DeepSeek/Kimi/OpenRouter, or Anthropic).
  (Backend not yet wired — see "Status".)

## Layout
- `app/login`, `app/workspace` — auth + tenant/account context selection.
- `app/(app)/{dashboard,campaigns,combine,analytics}` — the four main screens, behind a workspace
  guard in `app/(app)/layout.tsx` (Sidebar + Topbar shell).
- `components/ui/` — shared design-system primitives (Card, Button, Badge, Modal, Tabs, charts, etc.).
  `Icon` takes a lucide PascalCase name string: `<Icon name="Download" />`. `cx` is the classname joiner.
- `components/shell/` — Sidebar, Topbar. `components/screens/<screen>/` — per-screen pieces.
- `lib/data.ts` — **the data seam**: domain metadata, formatters, and (currently) seeded mock data.
  Swap these for real API responses when wiring the backend. `lib/types.ts` — domain types.
- `lib/store.tsx` — `AppProvider` / `useApp()`: workspace, currency, dateRange, and the batch-id
  selection passed into Combine/Analytics (sessionStorage-persisted).

## Domain model (important)
A **batch** = one bulk job's result. `selType(batch)` ∈ `ai | ivr | message` governs the hard rule:
you may only multi-select / combine / analyze-together batches of the **same selType**. `typeKey` keeps
messaging channels distinct for badges (`ai | ivr | whatsapp | telegram | email`).

## Status
- ✅ Full UI ported from the design handoff. `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npx tsc --noEmit` pass.
- ✅ Backend V1 built (see `BACKEND.md`): magick-master client, iron-session auth, MongoDB layer,
  in-process ingestion worker (`instrumentation.ts` → `lib/server/worker.ts`), pluggable LLM, and all
  BFF routes under `app/api/*` (auth, campaigns, ingest, jobs, export [streamed CSV], analytics,
  insights, chat [SSE]). `lib/api.ts` is the client seam with **mock fallback** — unset env ⇒ the UI
  runs on `lib/data.ts`; set env ⇒ live data.
- ✅ All four screens wired through `lib/api.ts`: Campaigns (list), Dashboard (stats/status-mix/recent +
  batch-derived volume series), Combine (real `merge` job poll + streamed CSV download), and Analytics
  (real ingest job poll → `getAnalytics` aggregates feed Overview/Cost/Conversation tabs; `generateInsights`
  for AI Insights; `streamChat` SSE for the chat box). Every path degrades to mock/canned when the
  backend/LLM is off, so the UI still runs with no env.
- ⏳ Next iterate: add real Firebase login to the login/workspace screens. Token refresh for long jobs,
  prettier batch ids, and GridFS export retention are deferred (noted in `BACKEND.md`).

## Conventions
- Client components that use hooks/state/recharts/handlers start with `"use client";`.
- Money always goes through `fmtMoney`/`fmtMoneyFull(inr, currency)` with `currency` from `useApp()`.
- Navigation: `useRouter()` from `next/navigation`; set `analyzeTargets`/`combineTargets` via `useApp()`
  before pushing to `/analytics` or `/combine`.
- This Next.js version has breaking changes vs training data — consult `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`.
